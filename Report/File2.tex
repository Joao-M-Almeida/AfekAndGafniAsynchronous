	In this example , \textit{Test 1}, two processes are trying to get elected. Process 2 is the first candidate and captures Process 1 immediately, making itself the elected process. The '\textit{Level Sum - Number of Processes}' is equal to the '\textit{Captures Sum}', which proves the correctness of the algorithm for two processes.

	With this example from \textit{Test 4} we want to prove that even if more than on candidate starts the election at the same time, the algorithm still works as expected.
