\section*{Tests}

To guarantee the quality of our implementation we ran multiple test, a summary of those tests is present in Table \ref{tab:testtable}.

For each test we measured a series of parameters to evaluate the output of algorithm. The parameters where:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Number of Level Increases:}} Sum of the levels of all processes 
\item{\textbf{Number of Capture Messages:}} Number of capture messages sent by all candidate nodes
\item{\textbf{Number of Captures:}} Number of captures that were successful, measured by the ordinary nodes
\item{\textbf{Number of Kill messages:}} Number of messages sent by ordinary nodes to kill their previous owner
\item{\textbf{Number of Acknowledgment messages:}}
\item{\textbf{Number of Capture/Level Discrepancies:}} The difference between the number of captures and number of level increases 

\end{itemize}

As you can see there is a difference between the number

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
[Process: 3]	[C]	Is now a Candidate.
[Process: 4]	[O]	Captured by Candidate Process: 3.
[Process: 2]	[O]	Captured by Candidate Process: 3.
[Process: 1]	[O]	Captured by Candidate Process: 3.
[Process: 5]	[O]	Captured by Candidate Process: 3.
[Process: 3]	[C]	Elected!! 
[Process: 1]	[C]	Level = 0.	Times Captured = 1.
[Process: 2]	[C]	Level = 0.	Times Captured = 1.
[Process: 3]	[C]	Level = 5.	Times Captured = 0.
[Process: 4]	[C]	Level = 0.	Times Captured = 1.
[Process: 5]	[C]	Level = 0.	Times Captured = 1.
[INFO]		[ ]	Level Sum = 5.	Captures Sum = 4.
